# Understanding Web Application Security and Attack Mitigation

Objective:
The objective of this lesson is to provide participants with a comprehensive 
understanding of web application architecture, security risks, and attack 
methodologies. By the end of the session, participants will be able to identify 
common web application threats, implement security measures to protect web 
applications, and understand the methodologies used by attackers to exploit 
vulnerabilities.
Module Outline:
Web Application Architecture
Overview of Web Application Components: Client-side, Server-
side, and Database
Understanding the Interaction Between Components in a Web 
Application
Common Web Application Technologies: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, 
PHP, ASP.NET, etc.
Web Application Threats
Identification of Common Threats Targeting Web Applications
Examples of Web Application Threats: SQL Injection, Cross-Site 
Scripting (XSS), Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), etc.
Impact of Web Application Threats on Data Integrity, Availability, 
and Confidentiality
